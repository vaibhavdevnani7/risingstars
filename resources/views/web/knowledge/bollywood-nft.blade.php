            Bollywood NFTs
          </h2>
          <br>
          <p>
           An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects or parts of objects such as
art, music, in-game items, and videos. These can be bought and sold online, just like
any other item.</p><p>The crypto and NFT mania have swept the nation. India&#39;s entertainment industry and
Bollywood Stars are also looking to cash in by launching their own NFTs. The NFTs are
giving Indian artists and creators a new avenue to gain exposure and income. It is also
allowing many copyright holders of popular entertainment to cash in on the craze by
offering their IP as NFT assets.</p>
<p>
Many superstars have boarded the NFT hype train such as Amitabh Bachchan, Sunny
Leone, Kailash Kher, etc. Some people are backing NFTs strongly by investing and
minting clips. Indians are very passionate about movies and movie stars have a huge
fan following within and outside India. Their fanbase can play a huge role in the sale of
exclusive digital artwork of their favorite Bollywood stars.</p>
<p>
But, NFTs are not as easy flooding the market and hoping that fans will buy it and stick
to it for nostalgic value. The craze of NFTs started as art, which is more or less
timeless. It is regarded as an investment in many cases. It is simply not a given that a
Salman Khan or Amitabh Bachchan NFT will be valuable in the long run.
